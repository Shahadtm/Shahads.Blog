# Shahads.Blog

Hello, 

This is my first Udacity project.

It's a blog. Hopefully, I will create the real one soon! 

I did multiple versions because I couldn't decide which one looked best and since I already designed the header pictures why not plug them in after building the page.

I added a navbar and a slideshow because it looks better this way.

Just in case, I did the basic Udacity mockup just like in the pdf using h1 and h2 for titles and more, but I don't like it and think the other version looks better.

I had fun creating fake blog posts titles and designing the pictures. I Hoppe you enjoy it too. 

I know you're not supposed to points the flaws, but I really want to know how to fix them:
first, how can I center the navbar links/text.
second, for some reason the page has a horizontal scroll bar, I don't why it's there I reviewed the code and couldn't figure it out. 

citation:
I only used code from sourced mentioned in the course. 
I cited as best I can. If there is any plagiarism, it wasn't intentional and I'll happily re-do the project.
