Hello, 

This is my first Udacity project.

It's a blog. Hopefully, I will create the real one soon!

How to run the project:
It's a mockup of a blog, however the links work. 

List of all the files and their purpose:
6 versions of HTML, the first 5 are the same just changed the header picture, because I couldn't decide which one looked best.
the Udacity version is a bit different and resembles the Udacity mockup more. 

A style sheet to style all the versions. 

Tools and Technologies used:
I used HTML5 and CSS and some Javascript to build the page. 

Citation:
I only used code from sourced mentioned in the course. 
I cited as best I can. If there is any plagiarism, it wasn't intentional and I'll happily re-do the project.
